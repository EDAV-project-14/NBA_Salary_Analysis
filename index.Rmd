# Introduction

In sports leagues, there tends to be huge gaps in the salaries among different players. Some superstars may earn hundreds of times as much as other regular players. On the other hand, some players may have been paid salaries that do not match their abilities. Our group decided to explore and evaluate a playerâ€™s deserving salary based on his contribution to the field. In our project, we will focus on the National Basketball Association (NBA) league and obtain the latest player statistics for the last few seasons from the Basketball Reference. Our goal is to work as data scientists to develop reasonable salary plans for NBA team owners based on historical statistics and data summary.
