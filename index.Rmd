# Introduction

In sports leagues, the salary differences between players tend to be huge. Superstars earn hundreds of times as much as regular players. However, some players have been paid salaries that do not match their abilities. How to evaluate a player's deserving salary based on his contribution on the field is the question that our project wants to explore. In our project, we focused on the NBA league and obtained the latest player stats for the last few seasons from Basketball Reference. Our goal is to work as data scientists to develop reasonable salary plans for NBA team owners.
