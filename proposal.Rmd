# Proposal

## Research topic

In sports leagues, there tends to be huge gaps in the salaries among different players. Some superstars may earn hundreds of times as much as other regular players. On the other hand, some players may have been paid salaries that do not match their abilities. Our group decided to explore and evaluate a player’s deserving salary based on his contribution to the field. In our project, we will focus on the NBA league and obtain the latest player statistics for the last few seasons from the Basketball Reference. Our goal is to work as data scientists to develop reasonable salary plans for NBA team owners.

## Data availability

Our data source is from [BasketBall Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a website serving up NBA and WNBA statistics and history. BasketBall Reference keeps pace with the times, updates the daily data and saves all the historical data since the creation of the NBA.

### Season summary

From this website, we will obtain our roster and player statics dataset from the [season summary](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/) page, which records the conference standings, division standings, playoff series, per game statics, and advanced stats. We will join these tables to measure the overall performance of the players. 

| Award Winners | Top Performers |                       |                  |                    |                  |                 |                    |                  |

| 2022-23       |      NBA       |                       |                  |                    | K. Durant (192)  | R. Gobert (91)  | T. Haliburton (70) |  N. Jokić (1.2)  |
| 2021-22       |      NBA       | Golden State Warriors |     N. Jokić     |     S. Barnes      | T. Young (2155)  | N. Jokić (1019) |   T. Young (737)   | N. Jokić (15.2)  |
| 2020-21       |      NBA       |    Milwaukee Bucks    |     N. Jokić     |      L. Ball       | S. Curry (2015)  | R. Gobert (960) | R. Westbrook (763) | N. Jokić (15.6)  |
| 2019-20       |      NBA       |  Los Angeles Lakers   | G. Antetokounmpo |     J. Morant      | J. Harden (2335) | R. Gobert (916) |   L. James (684)   | J. Harden (13.1) |

Note that this is just a rough measurement of player performance, because some players' value cannot be simply reflected by the data. And another assumption underlying is that the games are equally weighted, we ignore the bias of some more important games.
