# Proposal

## Research topic

In sports leagues, the salary differences between players tend to be huge. Superstars earn hundreds of times as much as regular players. However, some players have been paid salaries that do not match their abilities. How to evaluate a player's deserving salary based on his contribution on the field is the question that our project wants to explore. In our project, we focused on the NBA league and obtained the latest player stats for the last few seasons from Basketball Reference. Our goal is to work as data scientists to develop reasonable salary plans for NBA team owners.

## Data availability

Our data source is [BasketBall Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a website serving up NBA and WNBA stats and history. BasketBall Reference keeps pace with the times, updates the daily data and saves all the historical data since the creation of the NBA.

### Season summary

In this website, we will obtain our roster and player statics dataset from the [season summary](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/) page, which records the conference standings, division standings, playoff series, per game statics, and advanced stats. We will join these tables to measure the overall performance of the player. 

| Award Winners | Top Performers |                       |                  |                    |                  |                 |                    |                  |
| :------------ | :------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------: | :----------------: | :--------------: | :-------------: | :----------------: | :--------------: |
| Season        |       Lg       |       Champion        |       MVP        | Rookie of the Year |      Points      |    Rebounds     |      Assists       |    Win Shares    |
| 2022-23       |      NBA       |                       |                  |                    | K. Durant (192)  | R. Gobert (91)  | T. Haliburton (70) |  N. Jokić (1.2)  |
| 2021-22       |      NBA       | Golden State Warriors |     N. Jokić     |     S. Barnes      | T. Young (2155)  | N. Jokić (1019) |   T. Young (737)   | N. Jokić (15.2)  |
| 2020-21       |      NBA       |    Milwaukee Bucks    |     N. Jokić     |      L. Ball       | S. Curry (2015)  | R. Gobert (960) | R. Westbrook (763) | N. Jokić (15.6)  |
| 2019-20       |      NBA       |  Los Angeles Lakers   | G. Antetokounmpo |     J. Morant      | J. Harden (2335) | R. Gobert (916) |   L. James (684)   | J. Harden (13.1) |

Note that this is just a rough measurement of player performance, because some players' value cannot be simply reflected by data. And another assumption underlying is that the games are equally weighted, we ignore the bias of some more important games.


### Contract

Players' income are stored in [contracts](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html), which includes the salaries of NBA players. For example, the largest contracts in the leaderboard are:

### Micellenous 

Basketball Reference also provides some other data, like playoff teams, team winning rate, salary caps, player agent company, and etc. But we assume the player salaries are not effected by these external factors, and they are only determined by players' performance on the court.
