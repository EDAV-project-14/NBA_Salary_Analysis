Facilitated by comprehensive and open-source NBA datasets, data analysts have the opportunity to dive deep into the player statistic data. Besides NBA players’ agency, audience are wondering whether there are any direct associations between their performances in the game and their salary. The NBA’s market capitalization has grown significantly in recent years, and that growth has fed back to the NBA stars, bringing an increase to the salary caps. Throughout this project, we work on the widely intriguing association between NBA players’ salary and performance. We want to explore which factors affect and contribute to the players’ salary the most, the variation in the salary of players among different age groups, and the divergence in the distribution of player salary levels between teams. In addition to these questions, we also seek to apply existing analysis to explore hidden information that is not directly presented in the data. By conducting exploratory data analysis and finding answers to those topics, we are hoping to provide the audience with useful information and help them to have a better understanding of the relationship between players’ performance and salary. We are expecting to provide practical and profitable suggestions for NBA team agencies to develop a reasonable salary plan. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In sports leagues, there tends to be huge gaps in the salaries among different players. Some superstars may earn hundreds of times as much as other regular players. On the other hand, some players may have been paid salaries that do not match their abilities. Our group decided to explore and evaluate a player’s deserving salary based on his contribution to the field. In our project, we will focus on the National Basketball Association (NBA) league and obtain the latest player statistics for the last few seasons from the Basketball Reference. Our goal is to work as data scientists to develop reasonable salary plans for NBA team owners based on historical statistics and data summary. 2.2 Data availability Our data source is from the BasketBall Reference, a website serving up NBA and WNBA statistics, scores and history. The BasketBall Reference keeps pace with the times, updates the daily data and saves all the historical data since the creation of the NBA. The BasketBall Reference is using the official NBA data, and the data is provided by SportRadar, the official statistics provider of the NBA. Some of the data are provided in csv format already, while others are unstructured and requires web scraping to be transformed into csv tables. Since we wanted to explore the data from latest five years, we also need to aggregate data from multiple pages. To import data, we utilized a loop function to scrape the data from multiple pages and collected the HTML data. Then we extracted column headers and rows, and added “year” as a column. After that, we created dataframe and exported to csv. Lastly, we combined all the data tables using the join function. 2.2.1 Season summary From this website, we will obtain our roster and player statics dataset from the season summary page, which records the conference standings, division standings, playoff series, per game statics, and advanced stats. We will join these tables to measure the overall performance of the players. Award Winners Top Performers Season Lg Champion MVP Rookie of the Year Points Rebounds Assists Win Shares 2022-23 NBA K. Durant (192) R. Gobert (91) T. Haliburton (70) N. Jokić (1.2) 2021-22 NBA Golden State Warriors N. Jokić S. Barnes T. Young (2155) N. Jokić (1019) T. Young (737) N.

Harden (2335) R. Gobert (916) L. James (684) J. Harden (13.1) Note that this is just a rough measurement of player performance, because some players’ value cannot be simply reflected by the data. Another assumption underlying is that the games are equally weighted, and we are ignoring the bias of some more important games. 2.2.2 Contract Players’ income data is stored in contracts, which includes the salaries of NBA players. For example, the largest contracts in the leaderboard are: Salary Rk Player Tm 2022-23 2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28 Guaranteed 1 Stephen Curry GSW $48,070,014 $51,915,615 $55,761,216 $59,606,817 $215,353,662 2 Russell Westbrook LAL $47,063,478 $47,063,478 3 LeBron James LAL $44,474,988 $53,369,986 $57,639,585 $97,844,974 4 Kevin Durant BRK $44,119,845 $47,649,433 $51,179,021 $54,708,609 $197,656,908 2.2.3 Miscellaneous The Basketball Reference also provides some other data, such as playoff teams, team winning rate, salary caps, player agent company, and etc. In the project, we assume the player salaries are not affected by these external factors, and they are only determined by players’ performance on the court. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources We scrape our data from the BasketBall Reference, where we focus on players’ performance in these aspects, rank，player，position，age，team，start games，field goals，field attempts，field precision，3-points，3-points attemps，3-points precision，2-points，2-points attemps，2-points precision，free-throws，free-throws attemps，free-throws precision，rebounds，assists，steals，blocks，turnovers，fouls and points per game. For their salaries, Basketball Reference doesn’t provide the historical archive, so we use the mean of the current contracts as evaluator, ignoring the guaranteed. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation We cleaned player_stat_total.csv and player_contract.csv separately and then merged the two datasets together. A preview of these two datasets is included in the proposal. Player Statistics Data Cleaning For player_stat_total.csv, we first dropped the player statistics collected before 2020. And then we dropped several columns that are unrelated to the contract salaries of the NBA players, including X, rank, pos (position of each player), and personal_fouls. X and rank are just two columns showing the index of each row, so we simply removed them. We dropped the position column because some players switch between multiple positions, which might cause confusion. For example, Stephen Curry plays PG and SG at the same time. The personal_fouls variable is not a meaningful indicator either, as it is impacted by too many unexpected variables, and the information about player performance could be better demonstrated by other variables. We also dropped columns that are redundant, including field_goals, field_goals_attempts, X3points, X3_points_attempts, X2points, X2points_attempts, freethrows, freethrows_attempts, orb (offensive rebound percentage), drb (defensive rebound percentage). These variables are either transformed into percentages in other columns (for example, field_goal_pct = field_goals_attempts/field_goals*100%, so we only kept field_goal_pct, and dropped field_goals_attempts as well as field_goals), or that the information has already been addressed in other columns (for example, trb (total rebound percentage) = orb (offensive rebound percentage) + drb (defensive rebound percentage), so we only kept trb). We also dropped players that have played fewer than 20 games in total from 2021 to 2022, since the statistics are less meaningful when the number of games is too small. The next step was to calculate the weighted average of each variable. We multiplied them by the ratio of the number of games per season to the total number of games of each player from 2021 to 2022. After this step, the player column becomes unique, meaning that one row corresponds to one specific player. The last step of cleaning player_stat_total.csv was to split the players into three groups by their age, as there are age limitations and restrictions for athletes. We categorize them into young, middle, and old categories according to the thresholds 25 and 33 Here is a preview of the cleaned player_stat_total.csv: ## # A tibble: 6 × 14 ## player sum_g…¹ avg_m…² avg_f…³ avg_X…⁴ avg_X…⁵ avg_f…⁶ avg_trb avg_a…⁷ avg_s…⁸ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Aaron… 175 29.4 0.489 0.331 0.566 0.695 5.77 2.9 0.643 ## 2 Aaron… 38 16.5 0.441 0.365 0.477 0.834 1.68 2.14 0.666 ## 3 Aaron… 35 24.2 0.463 0.304 0.573 0.729 3.6 1.4 0.6 ## 4 Al Ho… 97 28.8 0.462 0.345 0.561 0.835 7.41 3.4 0.758 ## 5 Al-Fa… 28 20.2 0.394 0.221 0.492 0.821 5.1 1.5 0.9 ## 6 Alec … 49 28.3 0.394 0.405 0.383 0.825 4.87 2.92 0.959 ## # … with 4 more variables: avg_blocks &lt;dbl&gt;, avg_turnovers &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # avg_points_per_game &lt;dbl&gt;, age &lt;fct&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​sum_games, ²​avg_min_per_game, ³​avg_field_goal_pct, ⁴​avg_X3points_pct, ## # ⁵​avg_X2points_pct, ⁶​avg_free_throws_pct, ⁷​avg_assists, ⁸​avg_steals Player Contract Salary Data Cleaning The original player contract dataset includes players’ name, team and their yearly contract salaries until 2028. Since the contract salary column was in character format, we transformed these columns into the numerical format. After that, we utilized mutate() function to add an additional column of contract salary mean by taking the average of all the contract salaries for each player. Here is a preview of the cleaned player_contract.csv: ## player team Salary2022_2023 Salary2023_2024 Salary2024_2025 ## 2 Stephen Curry GSW 48070014 51915615 55761216 ## 3 Russell Westbrook LAL 47063478 NA NA ## 4 LeBron James LAL 44474988 53369986 57639585 ## 5 Kevin Durant BRK 44119845 47649433 51179021 ## 6 Bradley Beal WAS 43279250 46741590 50203930 ## 7 Damian Lillard POR 42492492 45640084 48787676 ## Salary2025_2026 Salary2026_2027 Salary2027_2028 Guaranteed ID ## 2 59606817 NA NA 215353662 curryst01 ## 3 NA NA NA 47063478 westbru01 ## 4 NA NA NA 97844974 jamesle01 ## 5 54708609 NA NA 197656908 duranke01 ## 6 53666270 57128610 NA 193891040 bealbr01 ## 7 58545211 63228828 NA 195465463 lillada01 ## SalaryMean ## 2 95659328 ## 3 47063478 ## 4 69618182 ## 5 87798493 ## 6 80326288 ## 7 82333452 Final Dataset After Cleaning Finally, we utilized merge() function to left join the cleaned player statistic dataset and cleaned player contract dataset by player name to get a final merged dataset for our project.We dropped the guaranteed salary column because it is a redundant variable, as all the contracts signed will be guaranteed for the remainder of the season. We also dropped the player id column as we already have the player name column to represent each player. Lastly, we simply divide the SalaryMean by 10000000 to make it more readable.

We discovered that columns of free_throws_pct and x3point_pct have the most number of rows missing. Missing Value Heatmap for Data After Cleaning After cleaning the data, as demonstrated in section 3.2, we got the tidy and representative data. We created the missing value heatmap according to the cleaned data using ggplot function to visualize missing values in each variable columns for each NBA player. From the heatmap, we observed that there are very little missing data in our dataset after data cleaning, demonstrating the effectiveness of our preprocessing methods. Column avg_X3points_pct has the most missing values, considering the fact that there are fewer players who have the opportunity to shoot three pointers in a game. Thus, we filled the missing values with zeros, e.g. Ivica Zubac and Jarrett Allen with no three pointers percision records are considered as not making any three pointers.

The graph shows that Stephen Curry has the highest salary of 95659328, followed by Devin Booker, with a contract salary mean of 90634700. On the other hand, D.J. Augustin has the lowest salary mean from our dataset. Additionally, we can observe a roughly right-skewed distribution of players’ salaries, with more players having below-average salary mean and fewer number of players with extremely high salaries. 4.2 Player Contract Salary Mean Distribution (Q-Q plot and Shapiro-Wilk normality test) ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: x ## W = 0.83822, p-value = 7.557e-16 Since salary distribution is known to be normal in most cases, we want to look at the normality of contract salary mean distribution of the players naturally. By comparing the graphical impressions from the Q-Q plot with the result of the Shpiro-Wilk Test (p-value = 7.7557e-16, much smaller than 0.05 and it’s significant), we conclude that the salary distribution generated from our sample is not normally distributed at all. Instead, the distribution of the contract salary means of the players in our sample is heavily right-skewed according to the Q-Q plot, as the data points appear to be clustered in the lower quantile. This result, as expected, shows that the top NBA players are paid much more than other players, as the teams try to keep the best-performing players with higher contract salaries. 4.3 Relationship between Player Contract Salary Mean and Age (Mosaic plot) Chi-square Test ## Young Middle Old ## Low 39 21 6 ## Middle 54 71 5 ## High 29 34 3 ## Young Middle Old ## Low 30.73282 31.74046 3.526718 ## Middle 60.53435 62.51908 6.946565 ## High 30.73282 31.74046 3.526718 ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: counts ## X-squared = 10.331, df = 4, p-value = 0.0352 Here is a mosaic plot showing the relationship between age and salary. We first categorized the continuous salary variable by splitting it into three groups. The salaries within the ‘Low’, ‘Middle’, and ‘High’ groups are bounded by 25th, 75th, and 100th percentiles respectively. From this figure, we can conclude that among the middle class in the league, middle-aged and young players make up the main part. But in the lower salary category, there are more younger players, which is in line with the NBA’s rookies salary terms. For the Chi-square test, we got a p-value value of 0.03, which is less than the significance level of 0.05. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the observed distribution is not the same as the expected distribution. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude an existing relationship between the categorical variables. 4.4 Relationship between Player Contract Salary Mean and Age (Boxplot) This figure demonstrates a box plot of players’ salary distribution related to their age. We observed that the salary variances and distribution of each age category are similar. However, the old players (&gt;33 years old) have the lowest salary median, and the middle age players have more outliers. After examining, we found the outlier players are mostly eminent and well-known players, such as Stephen Curry and Lebron James. This indicates that famous players are more likely to have higher salaries. 4.5 Player Contract Salary Mean for Different Teams (Ridgeline plot) Here is a ridgeline plot of players’ salaries grouped by the NBA teams. In most of the teams (HOU, ORL, SAS, etc), the salary distribution appears to be unimodal. We discovered that most of these uni-modal teams have not entered the playoffs in recent years, therefore it is reasonable to make a conclusion that this is because these teams do not have an absolute single or multiple core players. Furthermore, we chose some playoff teams and teams with superstars to examine their modality of salary mean. For LAL team led by Lebron James, Russel Westbrook and Anthony Davis, the salary is bimodal. Likewise, we observed a similar pattern for LAC team led by Paul George and Kawhi Leonard. However, for playoff team BOS, there is only one modal, this is because Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are still young players, whose salaries might not be as high as the other eminent and experienced players. Another interesting finding is that the teams with relatively higher salaries have higher chances of entering the playoffs. This could be an indication that a higher salary can trigger better performance of the players. 4.6 Parallel Coordinate Plot This figure shows a parallel coordinate plot using the ggparcoord() function, and it displays the relationship among the variables. From the plot, we can conclude a roughly positive relationship between avg_points_per_game and SalaryMean, and a roughly negative relationship between avg_min_per_game and avg_field_goal_pct. 4.7 Player Contract Salary Mean vs All Continuous Player Statistics (PCA) We generated a PCA graph using prcomp() function. We extracted the two most significant PCA features from those, which could explain roughly 60% importance of the final results. Stephen Curry is supposed to have the highest salary in our dataset, but the biplot above shows that he is not the most well-paid player. Thus we can’t fully rely on this plot itself. We observed that the salary has the strongest association with the number of games, average turnovers and average points per game, since their arrow lines are pointing to the same direction. This is intuitive because these variables are closely related to the possession of the ball in the game – important players tend to play more games and have more possession of the ball. On the other side, the average three points precision and average two points precision have the least correlation with the salary, as their arrow lines are perpendicular to salaries. Another interesting finding is that the inside players (center and power forward) are mostly distributed on the upper-right with more rebounds, and two pointers, e.g., DeAndre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, JaVale McGee. Moreover, (Point guard, shooting guard , Small forward) are mostly distributed on the left-bottom, with more assists, steals and three pointers, e.g., Kyrie Irving, Trae Young, Chris Paul. 4.8 Average Points per Game vs Player Contract Salary Mean (Scatterplot) Here is a scatterplot of players’ salary related to their average points per game. We utilized geom_smooth() to fit these points, and we observed a roughly linear correlation between player salary and the average points per game. It is indicated that players who earned more points in each game on average tend to have higher salaries. One possible reason for this is that these players have more possessions of the ball during the games. 4.9 Player Contract Salary Mean vs Total Number of Games Conditioning on Age Group (Multi-facets Scatterplot) Our PCA plot suggests that the sum_games has strongest association with players’ salary, sp we get a categorical scatter plot of salary mean related to this variable. We notice that there is no clear positive association in the middle age, which makes up a major part of the player population. A possible explanation for this is that there are many outliers in this group. Alternatively, in old and young age range, we can observe a more positive relationship between the sum games and salary mean. 4.10 Player Contract Salary Mean vs Team and Age Group (Heatmap) Here is a heatmap regarding players’ team and age, where we observed the salary related to players’ age in each team. Three most representative teams in this plot are LAL, GSW, and DAL. In LAL, old players tend to have the highest salary mean. In GSW, middle age players tend to have high salary, such as Stephen Curry, Klay Tompson and Andrew Wiggins are all among middle age rank. In DAL, younger players tend to have higher salary, such as Tim Hardway JR. and Luca Doncic. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component We observed a roughly linear correlation between player salary and the average points per game. It is indicated that players who earned more points in each game on average tend to have higher salaries. One possible reason for this is that these players have more possessions of the ball during the games. Put your mouse over the dots to see the salary and average points per game for each player: Reference: https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/scatter_basic.html "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In this project, we produce an exploratory data analysis on NBA players’ statistics and salaries. We utilized dot plot, heatmaps, parallel coordinate plot, and etc. to analyze the normality, modality, and distributions of the dataset. We discover that the NBA players’ salaries roughly follow a normal distribution, and there is a positive correlation between their performance and salary — the number of games, average points/min/rebounds/assists per game are positively correlated to the player salaries. We also discretize the age and salary data to categorical variables to explore the play composition in each team and how age affects the players’ salaries. We notice that major players in different groups have similar salary variance, and the players in middle age (25-33) tend to have the highest median, and there are more superstar players in peak performance that have extremely high salaries, where they are salary outliers in this category. Our figures not only show some superficial relationships and features, but also reveal some hidden information that the original data did not express. This indicates that our project not only stops at simple data analysis, but also provides a direction for continuing to explore data. For example, in our PCA analysis, we were surprised to find that the adjacent feature can represent the position information of the player (we eliminate this when cleaning data considering the ambiguity of position). The data points in the upper right corner are often inside players, where their arrows point to the same direction of rebounds and blocks in the original feature. The data points in the lower left corner are often outside players, and their arrows points to the same direction as three-pointers and free throws. In the salary ridgeline plot with respect to the player teams, we can roughly infer the team’s player composition structure (how many cores, whether it is a playoff team or not). By comparing with the reality, we conclude several limitations of our analysis. First and foremost, we do not take into account the impact of team market value and playoff performance in recent years on salaries. Some wealthy teams are more willing to pay high salaries for high-level players, while owners of small ball markets do not have the ability to afford excessive luxury taxes. Secondly, we did not take into account the impact of player injuries, trades, and off-field public opinion on their performance. For example, the sudden drop of performance caused by injury, stars with special significance to a certain team, and players with negative news influence outside the court are potential noise in the data that we are not eliminating. Lastly, for certain years, the players’ performance are not associated with their salaries. Because of the availability of the datasets, we use the mean of the 2022-2028 salaries, which could be more vulnerable to the noise mentioned above. In addition, it is too utilitarian to use rigid data to measure players, and the value of some players cannot only be expressed through these basic data. During the playoffs, the performance of key players can often determine the future of a team. Therefore, in addition to the regular season, key players’ achievement is a crucial factor. For example, Jordan Pool earns a profitable salary because of his great performance in GSW’s champion playoffs. In the future, we will consider integrating both the regular season and playoff data for more accurate analysis. To overcome the limited representation of the basic data, we will also contemplate higher-level statistics such as player plus/minus (whether a player’s presence wins points for the team), shooting efficiency (the number of points a player can make with his shots), and player defensive efficiency (how much his defense can give the opponent shooting precision drop). Throughout this project, we acquire a better understanding of the basic pipeline of explorative data analysis, regarding how informative the simple datasets can be. We master the skills to visualize the data and deliver our findings to the audience professionally using plotting languages. We also familiarized ourselves with data preprocessing techniques, and get more understanding of how to make our data tidy to serve for the more complicated analysis such as fitting and prediction in our future study.
