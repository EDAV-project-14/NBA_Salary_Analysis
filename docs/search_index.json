Some superstars may earn hundreds of times as much as other regular players. On the other hand, some players may have been paid salaries that do not match their abilities. Our group decided to explore and evaluate a player’s deserving salary based on his contribution to the field. In our project, we will focus on the National Basketball Association (NBA) league and obtain the latest player statistics for the last few seasons from the Basketball Reference. Our goal is to work as data scientists to develop reasonable salary plans for NBA team owners based on historical statistics and data summary.

Some superstars may earn hundreds of times as much as other regular players. On the other hand, some players may have been paid salaries that do not match their abilities. Our group decided to explore and evaluate a player’s deserving salary based on his contribution to the field. In our project, we will focus on the National Basketball Association (NBA) league and obtain the latest player statistics for the last few seasons from the Basketball Reference. Our goal is to work as data scientists to develop reasonable salary plans for NBA team owners based on historical statistics and data summary. 2.2 Data availability Our data source is from the BasketBall Reference, a website serving up NBA and WNBA statistics, scores and history. The BasketBall Reference keeps pace with the times, updates the daily data and saves all the historical data since the creation of the NBA. The BasketBall Reference is using the official NBA data, and the data is provided by SportRadar, the official statistics provider of the NBA. Some of the data are provided in csv format already, while others are unstructured and requires web scraping to be transformed into csv tables. Since we wanted to explore the data from latest five years, we also need to aggregate data from multiple pages. To import data, we utilized a loop function to scrape the data from multiple pages and collected the HTML data. Then we extracted column headers and rows, and added “year” as a column. After that, we created dataframe and exported to csv. Lastly, we combined all the data tables using the join function. 2.2.1 Season summary From this website, we will obtain our roster and player statics dataset from the season summary page, which records the conference standings, division standings, playoff series, per game statics, and advanced stats. We will join these tables to measure the overall performance of the players. Award Winners Top Performers Season Lg Champion MVP Rookie of the Year Points Rebounds Assists Win Shares 2022-23 NBA K. Durant (192) R. Gobert (91) T. Haliburton (70) N. Jokić (1.2) 2021-22 NBA Golden State Warriors N. Jokić S. Barnes T. Young (2155) N. Jokić (1019) T. Young (737) N. Jokić (15.2) 2020-21 NBA Milwaukee Bucks N. Jokić L. Ball S. Curry (2015) R. Gobert (960) R. Westbrook (763) N. Jokić (15.6) 2019-20 NBA Los Angeles Lakers G. Antetokounmpo J. Morant J. Harden (2335) R. Gobert (916) L. James (684) J. Harden (13.1) Note that this is just a rough measurement of player performance, because some players’ value cannot be simply reflected by the data. Another assumption underlying is that the games are equally weighted, and we are ignoring the bias of some more important games. 2.2.2 Contract Players’ income data is stored in contracts, which includes the salaries of NBA players. For example, the largest contracts in the leaderboard are: Salary Rk Player Tm 2022-23 2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28 Guaranteed 1 Stephen Curry GSW $48,070,014 $51,915,615 $55,761,216 $59,606,817 $215,353,662 2 Russell Westbrook LAL $47,063,478 $47,063,478 3 LeBron James LAL $44,474,988 $53,369,986 $57,639,585 $97,844,974 4 Kevin Durant BRK $44,119,845 $47,649,433 $51,179,021 $54,708,609 $197,656,908 2.2.3 Miscellaneous The Basketball Reference also provides some other data, such as playoff teams, team winning rate, salary caps, player agent company, and etc. In the project, we assume the player salaries are not affected by these external factors, and they are only determined by players’ performance on the court. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources We scrape our data from the BasketBall Reference, where we focus on players’ performance in these aspects, rank，player，position，age，team，start games，field goals，field attempts，field precision，3-points，3-points attemps，3-points precision，2-points，2-points attemps，2-points precision，free-throws，free-throws attemps，free-throws precision，rebounds，assists，steals，blocks，turnovers，fouls and points per game. For their salaries, Basketball Reference doesn’t provide the historical archive, so we use the mean of the current contracts as evaluator, ignoring the guaranteed. Here are the brief summary of player statics and contracts. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation The only columns that contain missing data are X3points_pct, X2point_pct, field_goals_pct, free_throws_pct, 3.3 Missing value analysis Missing Value Plot messy data Missing Value Heatmap clean data "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results Cleveland dot plot QQ plot (Shapiro-Wilk normality test) ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: x ## W = 0.83822, p-value = 7.557e-16 Mosaic plot Chi-square ## Young Middle Old ## Low 39 21 6 ## Middle 54 71 5 ## High 29 34 3 ## Young Middle Old ## Low 30.73282 31.74046 3.526718 ## Middle 60.53435 62.51908 6.946565 ## High 30.73282 31.74046 3.526718 ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: counts ## X-squared = 10.331, df = 4, p-value = 0.0352 Boxplot Ridgeline plot Parallel coordinate plot PCA Scatterplot - avg point vs salary Scatterplot - sum game vs salary mean Heatmap "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Put your mouse over the dots to see the salary and average points per game for each player: "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
