# NBA Player Salary Prediction

Jordan Poole signed a four-year, $140 million extension with the Warriors this summer, according to Woj. Despite his excellent performance in last year's championship season, there were still a lot of doubts, and many people thought the contract was too big. After all, 20 years ago, the league's salary cap was only more than 20 million US dollars. 

In NBA, there is a huge gap between the players' salaries. Generally speaking, the higher the ability, the higher the salary. But there are always some counter-examples that make the boss miserable. How to position players' salaries based on their data, this is what our project discusses.
