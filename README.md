# NBA Player Salary Analysis

Jordan Poole signed a four-year, $140 million extension with the Warriors this summer, according to Woj. Despite his excellent performance in last year's championship season, there were still a lot of doubts, and many people thought the contract was too big. After all, 20 years ago, the league's salary cap was only more than 20 million US dollars. 

In NBA, there is a huge gap between the players' salaries. Generally speaking, the higher the ability, the higher the salary. But there are always some counter-examples that make the boss miserable. Throughout this project, we work on the widely intriguing association between NBA players’ salary and performance. We want to explore which factors affect and contribute to the players’ salary the most, the variation in the salary of players among different age groups, and the divergence in the distribution of player salary levels between teams. In addition to these questions, we also seek to apply existing analysis to explore hidden information that is not directly presented in the data. By conducting exploratory data analysis and finding answers to those topics, we are hoping to provide the audience with useful information and help them to have a better understanding of the relationship between players’ performance and salary. We are expecting to provide practical and profitable suggestions for NBA team agencies to develop a reasonable salary plan.
